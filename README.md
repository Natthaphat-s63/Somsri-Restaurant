# Week2
The main goals of this week are:
  - Generating queue number and save it into database.
  - Calculate the remaining queue.
  - Sending queue number and remaining queue back to frontend.

# Major change
  - Delete reserve time in both frontend and backend including in database.
# Report for Frontend
Redesign the UI to make it show queue number and remianing number (Does not implementing pub and sub in this frontend) and make it work on both in computer and mobile.
And we decide to delete the reserve time because it's not in our concept work.
# Report for Backend
